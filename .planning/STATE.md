# STATE — GetVul GSD Session Memory

## Project Reference

See: [.planning/PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** A vuln-triage analyst can open one dashboard, see the same CVE-on-host correlated across multiple scanners, identify the asset's owner from IdP/MDM/HR, and ship a Jira/Asana ticket — without ever opening a scanner console.

**Current focus:** Phase 15 — mobile-a11y-perf-quality-gate

## Current Position

Phase: 15 (mobile-a11y-perf-quality-gate) — EXECUTING
Plan: 5 of 6
| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Active milestone | v2.0 UI/UX Redesign |
| Active phase | 15 — Mobile + a11y + Perf Quality Gate (EXECUTING) |
| Last action | 2026-06-26 — Plan 04 complete: jsx-a11y zero-error sweep; keyboard-operable interactive rows + dialog backdrop keyboard parity; npm run lint exits 0 |
| Next action | Execute Phase 15 Plan 05 |
| Phase numbering | Continues from v1.0's last phase (8). v2.0 occupies Phases 9–15. |

## v2.0 Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 9 | `/login` + Foundation | UX-01-01..05, UX-F-01..04 |
| 10 | `/dashboard` | UX-02-01..06 |
| 11 | `/vulnerabilities` + State Patterns | UX-03-01..06, UX-S-01..05 |
| 12 | `/assets` List + Detail | UX-04-01..05 |
| 13 | `/tickets` List + Detail | UX-05-01..06 |
| 14 | Remaining Screens | UX-06-01..04 |
| 15 | Mobile + a11y + Perf Quality Gate | UX-07-01..07 |

Coverage: 50/50 v2.0 requirements mapped. Foundation (UX-F-*) embedded in Phase 9 — no foundation-only phase. UX-D-* (future) and Out of Scope items intentionally unmapped.

## Deferred — v1.0 Production Readiness

v1.0 Phase 1 (Multi-Replica State) shipped 2026-05-09. Phases 2–8 deferred while v2.0 redesign takes precedence. Backend hardening work doesn't share files with frontend rebuild — can resume as a future v1.1 milestone in parallel or sequentially.

Phases preserved in [.planning/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) under the collapsed v1.0 section for reference. Recovery branch from the rolled-back v2-01 attempt: `v2-01-rollback-recovery` (at commit `c09194c`).

## Audit Reference

The v1.0 roadmap is sourced from a codebase audit performed 2026-05-08 against commit `8cede77`. The v2.0 redesign is sourced from a 6-sketch design exploration on 2026-05-12 — see [.planning/sketches/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md](sketches/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md) and `.claude/skills/sketch-findings-getvul/SKILL.md`.

## Workflow Notes

- GSD installed locally to `.claude/` via `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest --claude --local` on 2026-05-08.
- Sketch findings skill auto-loads on UI work per [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) routing — every frontend implementation phase consumes the 7 reference files.
- v0.1 features in [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) "Validated Requirements" remain intact; v2.0 rebuilds the UI surface, not the backend.
- **Anti-pattern guarded:** No foundation-only phase. UX-F-01..F-04 (token system, theme architecture, persistent shell, first primitive set) ride inside Phase 9. The rolled-back v2-01 attempt failed because it shipped foundation without a visible screen ("looks worse than before"). v2.0 ships visible screens from day one.

## Decisions

- DrillPanel chrome generalized additively (D-D-02): idKey/id/renderContent/ariaLabel props with vuln-preserving defaults; cveId kept as back-compat alias
- close() deletes 'open' + active idKey; ticket callers pass idKey='ticket'; vuln callers get default idKey='cve'
- TicketDrillData type exported from ticket-drill-content.tsx for Plan 07 contract
- renderBlockedToggle slot renders disabled placeholder when absent (Plan 06/08 wires real BlockedToggle)
- WatcherStack role-priority Map dedupes by userId (assignee=0, reporter=1, watcher=2); strongest wins per unique userId
- ActivityTimeline groups by local calendar day key (YYYY-MM-DD) to avoid locale issues; ascending sort D-C-04
- BlockedToggle whitespace-only reason coerces to null per D-P-02; backend validator mirrors this
- CommentInput Ctrl/Cmd+Enter shortcut; char-count warning at 9500 chars before 10000 hard limit
- TicketAssetCard null assetId renders "Multiple hosts" with no link (multi-host ticket safety)
- asana_not_configured error renders connector deep-link EmptyState (D-S-02), not PartialFailureBanner — expected "unconfigured" signal vs transient failure
- useMarkBlocked patches both byId cache AND list cache in onMutate for immediate table row update
- Predicate-based invalidation targets ['assets', *, 'remediations'] on blocked toggle success (RESEARCH Pattern 4)
- Board placeholder copy verbatim: "Board view coming in a future update — for now, use the List view with the Status chip filter to organize work by status."
- CURRENT_USER_ID = '' stub in /tickets/[id] page: no established global user hook; watch toggle functional (server truth authoritative on invalidation); optimistic 'You' watcher patch is degraded until a session context is introduced
- buildWatcherList constructs D-W-04-compliant role-tagged watcher list on the page (not inside WatcherStack): merge assignee+reporter+watchers, dedupe by userId (strongest role: assignee=0 > reporter=1 > watcher=2), sort chronologically
- Phase 15-01: used --legacy-peer-deps for npm install (lucide-react 0.383.0 peer react@^18 vs project's React 19); consistent with existing overrides in package.json
- Phase 15-01: Playwright 1.61.1 resolved (plan specified ~1.60); API-compatible, no breaking changes
- Phase 15-02: nav-items.ts single source-of-truth for all 9 nav destinations consumed by sidebar/bottom-nav/drawer/more-sheet
- Phase 15-02: NavDrawer kept mounted with translate (not null-guarded) for motion-safe:transition; NavMoreSheet uses null-guard (vaul portal lifecycle)
- Phase 15-02: topbar.tsx promoted to 'use client' — onMenuClick/hamburgerRef props added; hamburger conditional on prop presence (backward-compatible)
- Phase 15-02: Bottom-nav gradient-strip on TOP edge (inverted from sidebar's left edge) per bar orientation
- Phase 15-02: MORE_ITEMS computed via Set subtraction from ALL_ITEMS — future BOTTOM_NAV_PRIMARY changes auto-update MORE_ITEMS
- Phase 15-03: ResponsiveDialog if(!open) return null guard (matches drill-panel-mobile precedent; preserves queryByRole('dialog')===null jsdom contract)
- Phase 15-03: isMobile guard skips programmatic focus + Tab trap in ConfirmModal — vaul manages focus natively on mobile
- Phase 15-03: Skeleton loading animate-pulse in hero.tsx NOT converted — transient state, acceptable via globals.css blanket per research audit
- Phase 15-03: motion-safe: Tailwind prefix used for gradient-drift + urgency dot (belt-and-suspenders alongside globals.css blanket; UX-07-04)
- Phase 15-04: watcher-stack.tsx Escape key moved to outer wrapper div (no role) — jsx-a11y/no-noninteractive-element-interactions satisfied without changing dialog semantics
- Phase 15-04: backdrop split pattern (role=presentation outer + role=dialog inner) — AT announces only the inner dialog; Escape/click-outside on outer div
- Phase 15-04: Wrapper.displayName='Wrapper' pattern for factory-returned test components (react/display-name); vitest-axe.d.ts eslint-disable comments removed (nonexistent rule)
