# STATE — GetVul GSD Session Memory

## Project Reference

See: [.planning/PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) (updated 2026-05-12)

**Core value:** A vuln-triage analyst can open one dashboard, see the same CVE-on-host correlated across multiple scanners, identify the asset's owner from IdP/MDM/HR, and ship a Jira/Asana ticket — without ever opening a scanner console.

**Current focus:** v2.0 UI/UX Redesign — rebuild every authenticated screen against the validated sunset-palette design system. Vertical-slice phases (1 phase = 1 shipped screen + its tokens + its primitives). Design contract: `.claude/skills/sketch-findings-getvul/`.

## Current Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Active milestone | v2.0 UI/UX Redesign |
| Active phase | None yet — roadmap landed; awaiting Phase 9 plan |
| Last action | 2026-05-12 — v2.0 roadmap created in [.planning/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md); 7 vertical-slice phases (9–15); 50/50 v2.0 requirements mapped |
| Next action | `/gsd-discuss-phase 9` (recommended) or `/gsd-plan-phase 9` for the first vertical slice (`/login` + foundation) |
| Phase numbering | Continues from v1.0's last phase (8). v2.0 occupies Phases 9–15. |

## v2.0 Phase Map

| Phase | Name | Requirements |
|-------|------|--------------|
| 9 | `/login` + Foundation | UX-01-01..05, UX-F-01..04 |
| 10 | `/dashboard` | UX-02-01..06 |
| 11 | `/vulnerabilities` + State Patterns | UX-03-01..06, UX-S-01..05 |
| 12 | `/assets` List + Detail | UX-04-01..05 |
| 13 | `/tickets` List + Detail | UX-05-01..06 |
| 14 | Remaining Screens | UX-06-01..04 |
| 15 | Mobile + a11y + Perf Quality Gate | UX-07-01..07 |

Coverage: 50/50 v2.0 requirements mapped. Foundation (UX-F-*) embedded in Phase 9 — no foundation-only phase. UX-D-* (future) and Out of Scope items intentionally unmapped.

## Deferred — v1.0 Production Readiness

v1.0 Phase 1 (Multi-Replica State) shipped 2026-05-09. Phases 2–8 deferred while v2.0 redesign takes precedence. Backend hardening work doesn't share files with frontend rebuild — can resume as a future v1.1 milestone in parallel or sequentially.

Phases preserved in [.planning/ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) under the collapsed v1.0 section for reference. Recovery branch from the rolled-back v2-01 attempt: `v2-01-rollback-recovery` (at commit `c09194c`).

## Audit Reference

The v1.0 roadmap is sourced from a codebase audit performed 2026-05-08 against commit `8cede77`. The v2.0 redesign is sourced from a 6-sketch design exploration on 2026-05-12 — see [.planning/sketches/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md](sketches/WRAP-UP-SUMMARY.md) and `.claude/skills/sketch-findings-getvul/SKILL.md`.

## Workflow Notes

- GSD installed locally to `.claude/` via `npx get-shit-done-cc@latest --claude --local` on 2026-05-08.
- Sketch findings skill auto-loads on UI work per [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) routing — every frontend implementation phase consumes the 7 reference files.
- v0.1 features in [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md) "Validated Requirements" remain intact; v2.0 rebuilds the UI surface, not the backend.
- **Anti-pattern guarded:** No foundation-only phase. UX-F-01..F-04 (token system, theme architecture, persistent shell, first primitive set) ride inside Phase 9. The rolled-back v2-01 attempt failed because it shipped foundation without a visible screen ("looks worse than before"). v2.0 ships visible screens from day one.
